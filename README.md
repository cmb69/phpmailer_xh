## Credits

The plugin is inspired by *olape* who made the CMSimple_XH community
aware of the need of direct SMTP sending of emails (instead of using
the `mail()` function of PHP).

Many thanks to all maintainers of PHPMailer for providing this simple
and great email solution over the years.

The plugin logo is from

Many thanks for making this icon freely available.

Many thanks to the community at the [CMSimple_XH forum](https://www.cmsimpleforum.com/)
for tips, suggestions and testing.

And last but not least many thanks to
[Peter Harteg](https://www.harteg.dk/), the “father” of CMSimple,
and all developers of [CMSimple\_XH](https://www.cmsimple-xh.org/)
without whom this amazing CMS would not exist.
