<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Phpmailer_XH is a plugin for <a href="https://www.cmsimple-xh.org/">CMSimple_XH</a>. It requires CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.7.0, and PHP ≥ 7.1.0.</p>
<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/phpmailer_xh/releases/latest">lastest release</a> is available for download on Github.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Backup the data on your server.</li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory <code>phpmailer/</code> to your server into the <code>plugins/</code> directory of CMSimple_XH.</li>
<li>Set write permissions for the subdirectories <code>config/</code> and <code>languages/</code>.</li>
<li>Navigate to <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Phpmailer</code> in the back-end to check if all requirements are fulfilled.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The configuration of the plugin is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in the back-end of the website. Select <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Phpmailer</code>.</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Phpmailer_XH under <code>Config</code>. Hints for the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done under <code>Language</code>. You can translate the character strings to your own language if there is no appropriate language file available, or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>First, you should configure your email address (<code>Plugins</code> → <code>Phpmailer</code> → <code>Config</code> -&gt; <code>Sender</code> → <code>Address</code>). The system check will do a basic validity check of the address.</p>
<p>Then you are encouraged to enable SMTP; see the following section.</p>
<h3 id="smtp">SMTP</h3>
<p>Per default, Phpmailer_XH uses the <code>mail()</code> function of PHP, which is typically just a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendmail">sendmail</a> wrapper. This way to send mails has some limitations, and is no longer supported by some Webservers.</p>
<p>Thus, you are encouraged to enable SMTP support in the configuration. It is important to properly fill in all relevant configuration settings; request the necessary information from your mail provider. If the SMTP server requires authentication (quite likely), you have to provide the username and password in the configuration. Note that these credentials are necessarily stored in plain text in <code>plugins/phpmailer/config/config.php</code>. Therefore it is important that the configuration folder of Phpmailer_XH is protected against direct access. The plugin ships with a respective <code>.htaccess</code> file, but this may not be recognized by your server, so you need to take suitable measures yourself. Before entering the sensitive credentials into the configuration, check whether the system check is green regarding the access protection of <code>config.php</code>.</p>
<p>If you have trouble with the SMTP configuration, i.e. some plugin using Phpmailer_XH cannot send emails, you can enable the <code>SMTP</code> → <code>Debug</code> configuration option. When you are logged in as administrator, a detailed log of the communication with the SMTP server will be shown if a mail is sent (note that this debug output may contain sensitve information; therefore it is never shown to visitors of your site). The debug output may already be sufficient for you to solve the issue; otherwise see <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>.</p>
<h3 id="for-developers">For Developers</h3>
<p>Other plugins can use PHPMailer exactly like before; they just need to remove their own <code>require</code> or <code>include</code> statements which include <code>PHPMailer</code> and possibly some additional helper classes (like <code>SMTP</code>), since the required classes will be autoloaded by CMSimple_XH.</p>
<p>For plugins using <code>XH\Mail</code>, there is a shim available: <code>PHPMailer\Mail</code>, which roughly works like before, but uses PHPMailer under the hood.</p>
<p>However, either variant would ignore the configuration of Phpmailer_XH, unless the plugin would apply that manually. The convenient way to use the Phpmailer_XH configuration is to create an instance of <code>PHPMailer</code> by calling</p>
<pre><code>phpmailer_create()</code></pre>
<p>This function returns a preconfigured <code>PHPMailer</code> which then can be used almost (see below) like before, for instance:</p>
<pre><code>$mail = phpmailer_create();
$mail-&gt;addAddress(&quot;joe@example.com&quot;);
$mail-&gt;Subject = &quot;Hey Joe!&quot;;
$mail-&gt;Body = &quot;where you goin’ with that gun in your hand?&quot;;
$mail-&gt;send();</code></pre>
<p>To apply the Phpmailer_XH configuration to <code>PHPMailer\Mail</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$mail = new PHPMailer\Mail(phpmailer_create());</code></pre>
<p>Note that you must not call any of the <code>PHPMailer</code> methods which change the sending method (i.e. <code>::isSMTP()</code>, <code>::isMail()</code> and <code>::isSendmail()</code>), since that would override the Phpmailer_XH configuration. That also applies to any SMTP configuration changes to the <code>PHPMailer</code> instance.</p>
<p>Also note that you must not change the sender/from address by calling <code>::setFrom()</code>, since this is alreay configured. Instead, call <code>::addReplyTo()</code> to set this address.</p>
<p>Note there is no more need to call <code>::setLanguage()</code>, since this is already done by <code>phpmailer_create()</code>.</p>
